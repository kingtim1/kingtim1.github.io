*Experience*

I joined Deep Mind as a Research Scientist in January 2015. From January 2013 – January 2015, I was a Senior Researcher at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology working with Shie Mannor. Before becoming a postdoc, I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University (Dissertation Advisor: Yoonsuck Choe). My main area of research is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning. I’ve spent the last four years improving Google’s recommender systems via advanced machine learning (e.g., applying techniques from the field of reinforcement learning).

My research has received recognition from various national and international organizations. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

*Biography*

I grew up in a small town outside of Burlington, Vermont. I enjoy playing guitar, painting, [illustrating](http://www.duckyadventures.com/), writing short stories, hiking, and snowboarding. I’ve been an active member of the SUNY Potsdam Philosophy Forum and the Brazos Valley Writers guild. I’m also an Oakland A’s fan.
