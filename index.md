**Experience**  
I am a Senior Staff Research Engineer at Google DeepMind leading teams focused on improving Ads and helping Google achieve their sustainability goals. Previously I was a Research Scientist Manager at Meta from October 2021 -- January 2023, where I focused on improving digital advertising by applying advanced machine learning and statistics. Prior to that I was a research scientist at DeepMind from January 2015 - September 2021. From January 2013 – January 2015, I was a Senior Researcher at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology working with Shie Mannor. Before becoming a postdoc, I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University (Dissertation Advisor: Yoonsuck Choe). My main area of research is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning. I’ve spent the last four years improving Google’s recommender systems via advanced machine learning (e.g., applying techniques from the field of reinforcement learning).

My research has received recognition from various national and international organizations. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

**Biography**  
I currently live in the Austin, TX area. I enjoy playing guitar, painting, writing short stories, hiking, and skiing/snowboarding. I’m also an Oakland A’s fan.
